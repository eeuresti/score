*Score* My attempt at remaking the ever so famous app "Tinder".

Built using Ruby, Ruby On Rails, Bootstrap, jQuery.

Things were running semi-smoothe in the developers stage but once I pushed to Heroku I ran into snags. One of the most noticable is the broken image once in. I am working on that hiccup and plan to continue working on the app in the future.
